Exercise 1.
        Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and 
        length of a room. Once the values have been read, your program should compute and display the area of the room. The length and the width will be entered as floating point numbers. Include units in your prompt and output message; 
        either feet or meters, depending on which unit you are more comfortable working with.

Exercise 2.
        In many jurisdictions a small deposit is added to drink containers to encourage people to recycle them. In one particular jurisdiction, drink containers holding one liter or less have a $0.10 deposit, and drink containers holding more than one liter have a $0.25 deposit.
        Write a program that reads the number of containers of each size from the user. Your program should continue by computing and displaying the refund that will be received for returning those containers. Format the output so that it includes a dollar sign and always displays exactly two decimal places.

Exercise 3.
        Create a program that reads two integers, a and b, from the user. 
        Your program should compute and display:
        a) The sum of a and b
        b) The difference when b is subtracted from a 
        c) The product of a and b
        d) The quotient when a is divided by b
        e) The remainder when a is divided by b
        f) The result of a in the power of b 

Exercise 4.
        Write a function that takes a list of numbers and iterates through each number on a list and counts all numbers that are equal to 1.

        a_list = [1,3,55,1,9,4,56,2,1,8]


Exercise 5.
        Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number of digits and letters.
        use: help() to learn how to use isalpha() and isdigit()
